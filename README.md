I have created this program to meet a specific need and I thought it would have been good to share it with someone who might need it.

I publish it experimentally and I will not give support.

# Usage:
To convert the .lqm files you have to copy them all to the folder **WorkingDirectory** where the executable is located: "C:\QuickMemo2Word\WorkingDirectory" and then double click on **QuickMemo2Word.exe**.

The program will create all the documents and saving them in the folders named like the categories of the notes.
