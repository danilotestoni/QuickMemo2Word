# QuickMemo2Word
Convert LG QuickMemo+ Notes .lqm files to .docx files with text and images.
This application use NuGet (https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocX) from DocX (https://github.com/xceedsoftware/DocX) to generate and edit word documents.

I have created this program to meet a specific need and I thought it would have been good to share it with someone who might need it.

I publish it experimentally and I will not give support.

# Usage:
To convert the .lqm files you have to copy them all to the folder where the executable is located: "\QuickMemo2Word\bin\Release\net7.0" and then double click on the QuickMemo2Word.exe.

The program will be in charge of creating the documents and saving them in the folders corresponding to the categories of the notes.
